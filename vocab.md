**FOCAL** 
-> functions. objects. conditionals. arrays. loops.

**parameters vs arguments** 

-> function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition
-> function arguments are the real values passed to the function

**higher order function**

-> any function that accepts a callback as a param is considered 'higher order'
-> other functions are just regular
