# NOTES

Sharing [my](https://github.com/teknoboten) notes from [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/) Web Developement Bootcamp. 

Consider this an attempt to redeem all the karma I burned while copying Char's notes in Chem 30S. :test_tube: Also, a worthwhile opportunity to practice markdown, and *maybe* move on from keeping all my notes in a giant note. I said *maybe*.
